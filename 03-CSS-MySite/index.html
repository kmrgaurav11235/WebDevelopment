    span, img, a are inline elements as opposed to p or h1 which are block elements. Block elements take
    the entire width of page and block other elements from appearing there. On the other hand, you cannot
    set the width property for inline elements.
    Block elements can be made inline by using "display: inline" in CSS. Similarly, Inline elements can be
    made Block by using "display: block" in CSS.
    Then, there is "display: inline-block" which allows us to change its width and doesn't take the
    entire width of page.
    Finally, "display: none" removes the entire element from display as if it weren't there.
    "visibility: none" can be used for similar results but keeps the place for the element blank and makes
    other elements flow around the hidden one.
